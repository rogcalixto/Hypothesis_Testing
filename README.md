# Hypothesis Testing: Women's vs. Men's Soccer Goals
This project performs a hypothesis test to determine if the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as in men's matches, using official FIFA World Cup match data since January 1, 2002. The analysis assumes each match is fully independent, ignoring team form.

## Objective
To test the null hypothesis at a 10% significance level:

Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as in men's.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is different from men's.
## Key Results
p-value: The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct.

Result: A decision to "reject" or "fail to reject" the null hypothesis based on the p-value and the significance level.
## Data
The analysis uses official FIFA World Cup match data since January 1, 2002.

## Methodology
Data Collection: Collect FIFA World Cup match data for both men's and women's matches.

Hypothesis Test: Perform an appropriate hypothesis test to calculate the p-value.

Decision Rule: Compare the p-value to the 10% significance level to determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
